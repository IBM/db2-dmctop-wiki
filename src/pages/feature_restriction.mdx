# Generating Explain data

  * The user ID you specify for dmctop to use must have sufficient privileges to
    create new or reuse existing Explain tables in the monitored database.

  * dmctop depends on some external DB2 utilities to format Explain data, such
    as db2exfmt.  The environment where dmctop was started must be setup such
    that dmctop can find and run these utilities or else attempts to generate
    Explain data for a SQL statement will fail.
