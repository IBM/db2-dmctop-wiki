# Purpose

Show a breakdown of where the monitored database is spending time, broken down to the full granularity provided by DB2.

--

This view shows where the database is spending its time.  You should be able to see at a glance if excessive time is being spent in non-productive areas, such as waiting on locks or writing to event monitors.  There are some uncommon but important scenarios that are difficult to diagnose other than by noticing that the server is spending time on something strange.

DB2 organizes the monitor elements for time spent in a hierarchy.  For example, there is a monitor element for time spent waiting, which is broken down into many individual elements covering the various things that activities wait for, such as locks, prefetchers, logging, etc.  The particular hierarchy shown by dsmtop is the “System Dimension” one, documented here:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.mon.doc/doc/c0055434.html?lang=en

For each element shown, we show what percentage it constitutes of each of its parent element.  In the current implementation, we present only a summarized view across all members, which means that the stats for the Fast Communication Subsystem (FCM), which routes data and requests between members, is excluded because there is no meaningful aggregation possible for these monitor elements.

Nesting (position in the hierarchy) is shown by indenting the names of the time monitor elements.

The last column shows the raw values for the elements.  So if the display mode is "count", this is the number of milliseconds the data server spent in that category since it was activated.
